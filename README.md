# weather-forecast

## Description

I am creating a weather forecast page to help people plan for a trip by checking what the weather will be like
at their destinations over the next few days, or just check what the weather will be like where they are.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can access the website using https://ultimavanguard.github.io/weather-forecast/ this link.

You can enter the city you want to get weather information for, hit enter and it will display the current weather, as well as the weather for the next five days.

When you enter in a valid city, that city gets saved to local storage and loaded to history. You can see the history for the last 15 cities you searched. You can click on any of
the history buttons to search for that city as well.

The local storage will also not store duplicate data and if you do search the same city it will move that to the beginning of local storage.

If there is an error during the fetch, an alert will let you know to try again.
